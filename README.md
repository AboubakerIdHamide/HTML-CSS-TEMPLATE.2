# HTML & CSS TEMPLATE2
This project is a continuation of the HTML and CSS template that I built by following along with a tutorial on YouTube. Through this project, I was able to further develop my skills in web design and learned how to use Font Awesome inside a CSS file. I also learned some basic commands in Git, which helped me to better understand version control. Overall, this project allowed me to build upon the knowledge and skills that I had acquired in my previous project and helped me to become more confident and proficient as a web developer.
